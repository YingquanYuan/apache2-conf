apache2-conf
============

This is my customized configuration of an HTTPS apache2 web server.

The src directory contains a standard configuration files bundle for setting up an apache2 web server.

The final deliverable through running **make** is a debian package, just run:
* sudo dpkg -i apache2-conf.deb
And all the customized configuration would get installed.
